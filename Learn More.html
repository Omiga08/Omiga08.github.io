<h2>Cardiovascular<br> Diseases</h2>
  <ol>
 <li>Coronary Artery Disease</li> 
 <p>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque (cholesterol and other substances). This reduces blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to chest pain (angina), heart attacks, or other heart-related complications.</p>
 <p><b>.Description:</b>.This damage is often due to the buildup of cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in your arteries and inflammation, a process known as atherosclerosis.</p>
